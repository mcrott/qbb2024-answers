## 1.1 Can you think of a reason why this sample does not match the expected GC content distribution and base content at the beginning of sequences?
Likely due to the fact this is from a specific tissue type and not every tissue. 

## 1.2 What is the origin of the most overrepresented sequence in this sample? Does it make sense?

The origin of the most represented sequence appears to be from a protease. This makes sense, as within the gut is where proteins are broken down, so proteases should be in abundance. 

## 2.1
26. By looking at the %Dups column of General Statistics, there are 26 samples that are less than 55% duplicates. 

Yes. Each triplicate appears to be relatively similar in location to each other on this graph. This would suggest the triplicates are all similar to each triplicate

## 3.3

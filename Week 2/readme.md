1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell? 

Exons appear to be under the most negative selection.  I can tell by looking that SNP enrichment of exons continues to go downward as MAF frequency increases.  Pressure on exons to have reduced SNP enrichment during increases in MAF frequency is critical as SNPs can cause multiple types of disruptive mutations within protein coding genes, causing dangerous phenotypes. 

2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases? 

- As time goes on SNPs and alleles can be negatived selected against resulting in a lower MAF frequency. This is due to there being more time for a older mutation to be filtered out of the population. While recent mutations are fresh within the population and readily prevalent due to a lack of filtering through natural selection.  

3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.]]

Yeah.  It appears that the regions of the genome that aren't encoding anything have the same amount of pressure. On the contary, exons which are generally critical for a proteins function, has significantly higher selective pressure placed on them.

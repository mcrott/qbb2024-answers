1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell? 

Exons appear to be under the most negative selection.  I can tell by looking that SNP enrichment of exons continues to go downward as MAF frequency increases. 

2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases? 

This is due to MAF being related to the second most common allele. Single SNPs are the most common driver of MAF enrichment and drive selection as SNPs accumulate in a certain region. As time goes on, that SNP + allele can be negatively selected, resulting in a decrease in MAF. 

3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.]]

Yeah.  It appears that the regions of the genome that aren't encoding anything have the same amount of pressure. On the contary, exons which are generally critical for a proteins function, has significantly higher selective pressure placed on them.

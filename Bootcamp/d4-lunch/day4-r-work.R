#it appears that there is less of an effect of age on the amount of dnms on the maternal side. This is due to a slope of 0.3776. While the paternal side
  # has a larger amount of dnms with a slope of 1.354.  paternal has a larger relationship in this case when compared to the maternal.  Id suspect based on
  # these relationships that paternal age influences the amount of DNMs at a greater rate than maternal.

  # What would be an appropriate statistical model to test this relationship? Fit this model to the data.
  # I will be using a paired sample t-test. Each output is coming from an individual and not a group, so we will be able to observe
  # the difference between the father and mother pairs

  # After performing your test, answer the following questions:
  #   
  # What statistical test did you choose? Why?
  # Paired t-test. Each sample is coming from an individual and not a group. So for each mother dnm there is a father dnm. 
  # Was your test result statistically significant? Interpret your result as it relates to the number of paternally and maternally inherited DNMs.
  # Yes. It was statistically significant with a p-value of 2.2e-16. This value indicates to us that our data is explained in a manner that
  # the amount of dnms is different between paternal/maternal lineages.

  #Step 2.6
  # Now that youâ€™ve visualized this relationship, you want to test whether there is a significant difference between
  # the number of maternally vs. paternally inherited DNMs per proband. 
  # 
  # What would be an appropriate statistical model to test this relationship? Fit this model to the data.
  # I will be using a paired sample t-test. Each output is coming from an individual and not a group, so we will be able to observe
  # the difference between the father and mother pairs

# t = 61.609, df = 395, p-value < 2.2e-16
# alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#   37.98284 40.48685
# sample estimates:
#   mean difference 
# 39.23485 
  
  # After performing your test, answer the following questions:
  #   
  # What statistical test did you choose? Why?
  # Paired t-test. Each sample is coming from an individual and not a group. So for each mother dnm there is a father dnm. 
  # Was your test result statistically significant? Interpret your result as it relates to the number of paternally and maternally inherited DNMs.
  # Yes. It was statistically significant with a p-value of 2.2e-16. This value indicates to us that our data is explained in a manner that
  # the amount of dnms is different between paternal/maternal lineages.

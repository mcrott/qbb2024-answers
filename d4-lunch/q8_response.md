### Question 8

I am not surprised by the results.  The pancreas has one of the highest expression levels as the exocrine and endocrine systems are critical for our bodies physiology. On the other hand, tissues such as the minor salivary gland or the pituitary gland more varied expression results most likely resulting from different signalling events in the body. We don't need hormones from the pituitary glands to be constantly made so these genes are most likely more heavily regulated than the ones in the pancreas.
